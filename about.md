### my history


A lifelong internet dweller, it seemed only right that after long enough I would end up opening a design studio. 
I have been building websites since 2008, when I stumbled into my first site-builder at the young age of  11.
Since then, I've spent my time pursuing traditional forms of design to build my understanding of what makes effective design.

I operate a small screen printing press personally, and produce small quantity prints on a pre-sale basis. <a href="https://thanosboyz.bigcartel.com"> Check my store for what I've een selling lately. </a>
