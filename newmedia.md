With over 20 years combined experience in new media fields, Corduroy Hat brings cutting edge techniques rooted in traditional practices.

# Web Design
Our team has built dozens of websites for everyone from artists, to management consultants, mid-range IT firms, and even concerts!
We can work within website frameworks like Wordpress, Squarespace, Drupal, and others, or we can develop a fresh experience for you from the ground up!

# App Design
We also offer app design services for clients of all sizes, and have built implementations for everything from simple business apps, to AR-enabled cameras, and clickable VR art-galleries.

# Prototyping
As with any other digital exploration, we place testing at the core of our prototyping experience, and can work with you to build wireframe and initial application prototypes.

# Digital Broadcast Services
Finally, Corduroy Hat is pleased to begin offering virtual broadcast management services. We can work with you to manage multi-channel virtual broadcasts via OBS. From the creation of assets for the broadcast itself, to development of lower-thirds, and animations, we can help you bring your virtual experience to life.
