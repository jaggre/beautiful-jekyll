Graphic by nature, designer by trade, Corduroy Hat can help with any logo or graphic needs. We're pretty much experts.


# Brand Visioning
Our team is experienced in brand visioning, and will work with you to determine the characteristics of your brand, startup, album, brewery, that should shine through in its' design. Drawing from trainings in critical media theory, graphic design, colour theory, and other disciplines, we will help you best represent yourself.

# Graphic Design
Corduroy Hat has produced digital assets for a number of clients, ranging from virtual billboards in massive online games, to small scale bootleg t-shirt printers. We can produce graphics for any installation, the only limitation is how big you're willing to think. We're familiar with applications like Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, as well as the Affinity suite!

# Logo Design
As with brand visioning, we will work with you to produce logos that let the best qualities of your brand shine through. In a world of cookie-cutter branding that is constantly getting ripped off of other people; why not be unique?
